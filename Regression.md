**Introduction to Regression**

Regression Model: A regression model expresses the relationship between the dependent variable (Y) and the independent variables (X) through a mathematical function. The goal is to create a model that accurately predicts the dependent variable based on the values of the independent variables.

Types of Variables: The dependent variable should be continuous, meaning it can take any value within a range. The independent variables can be either categorical (e.g., type of fuel) or continuous (e.g., engine size).

Simple Regression: Simple regression involves using one independent variable to estimate the dependent variable. It can be linear or non-linear, depending on the nature of the relationship between the variables. For example, we can predict CO2 emissions using the engine size as the independent variable.

Multiple Regression: Multiple regression involves using more than one independent variable to estimate the dependent variable. It can also be linear or non-linear, depending on the relationship between the variables. For example, we can predict CO2 emissions using both the engine size and the number of cylinders as independent variables.

Applications of Regression: Regression analysis has various applications. It can be used in sales forecasting, where independent variables like age, education, and experience can predict a salesperson's yearly sales. It can also be used in psychology to determine individual satisfaction based on demographic and psychological factors. Other applications include predicting house prices based on size and number of bedrooms, or employment income based on variables like hours of work, education, occupation, and more.

Importance of Regression: Regression analysis is valuable in many fields, including finance, healthcare, retail, and others. Different regression algorithms exist, each suited to specific conditions and purposes. While this video covers only a few techniques, it provides a foundation for exploring and understanding various regression methods.

Conclusion: Regression analysis is a powerful tool for predicting continuous values based on other variables. By using historical data and regression models, we can estimate the CO2 emissions of new or unknown cars, among many other applications.
