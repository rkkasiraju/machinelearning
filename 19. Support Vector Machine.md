# Support Vector Machine (SVM) Notes

## Introduction
- SVM is a machine learning method used for classification.
- It's effective in various domains, like medical diagnostics.
- SVM helps classify data, even when it's not linearly separable.

## SVM Definition
- SVM is a supervised algorithm that classifies by finding a separator.
- It maps data to a high-dimensional feature space for separation.
- The goal is to draw a hyperplane as the separator.

## Data Transformation
- Transforming data is crucial for SVM.
- Higher-dimensional spaces are created for linear separation.
- This process is known as "kernelling."

## Kernel Functions
- Different types of kernel functions are available:
  - Linear
  - Polynomial
  - Radial Basis Function (RBF)
  - Sigmoid
- The choice of the kernel function depends on the dataset.
- Experiment with different functions to compare results.

## Finding the Optimized Separator
- SVM aims to find the hyperplane that maximizes the margin.
- Support vectors are examples closest to the hyperplane.
- Only support vectors matter for classification.
- The optimization problem is solved by gradient descent.

## SVM Output
- The output includes values 'w' and 'b' for the line equation.
- Use the equation to classify new points.

## Advantages of SVM
- Accurate in high-dimensional spaces.
- Memory-efficient as it uses a subset of training points.
- Effective for image analysis and text mining tasks.

## Disadvantages of SVM
- Prone to over-fitting with many features and few samples.
- Does not directly provide probability estimates.
- Computationally inefficient with large datasets (>1,000 rows).

## Use Cases
- Image analysis tasks (e.g., image classification).
- Text mining tasks (e.g., spam detection, sentiment analysis).
- Gene expression data classification.
- Regression, outlier detection, and clustering.

## Conclusion
- SVM is a powerful classification algorithm.
- Its applications span various domains.
- Explore specific use cases to learn more.

This concludes the summary of Support Vector Machines (SVM).
