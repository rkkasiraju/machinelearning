# Fundamentals of Machine Learning with Python Course

## Course Overview
- Introduction to machine learning.
- Application of various machine learning algorithms in real-world scenarios.

## Applications of Machine Learning
- Machine learning is used in various fields and industries:
  - **Self-driving cars**: For object classification (e.g., people, traffic signs, other cars).
  - **Cloud computing services**: To protect against attacks (e.g., DDoS) and detect suspicious activities.
  - **Stock market analysis**: Identifying trends and patterns to make trading decisions.
  - **Medical diagnosis**: Detecting potential tumors using x-ray scans.

## Course Structure
- Four modules:
  1. **Introduction and Regression**
  2. **Classification**
  3. **Clustering**
  4. **Final Project**
- Each module includes videos and hands-on labs.
- Labs use **Jupyter Lab** hosted on Skills Network Labs, and Python with libraries like **Pandas**, **Numpy**, and **Scikit-Learn**.
- Explore different machine learning algorithms and work with various datasets.

## Module Topics
1. **Introduction and Regression**:
   - **Linear Regression**: Estimate CO2 emissions of cars and predict emissions for future cars.
2. **Classification**:
   - **Regression Trees**: Predict house prices using real estate data.
   - **Logistic Regression**: Predict customer loyalty using telecom data.
   - **K-nearest neighbors**: Classify telecom customers.
   - **Support Vector Machines**: Classify human cell samples as benign or malignant.
   - **Multiclass Prediction**: Classify iris flower types.
3. **Clustering**:
   - **Decision Trees**: Build a model to prescribe drugs to patients.
   - **K-means**: Segment customer data into groups based on characteristics.
4. **Final Project**:
   - Apply classification algorithms to predict rainfall in Australia.

## Course Outcomes
- After completing the course, you will:
  - Explain, compare, and contrast machine learning topics and concepts (supervised learning, unsupervised learning, classification, regression, and clustering).
  - Describe how various machine learning algorithms work.
  - Learn to apply these machine learning algorithms in Python using libraries like Pandas, Numpy, and Scikit-Learn.
