# Building Decision Trees in Classification

In this video, we'll explore the process of building decision trees, a fundamental method for classifying data. Decision trees are constructed using recursive partitioning to effectively classify data into categories.

## Decision Tree Construction Process

1. **Data Set Selection:** To build a decision tree, we start with a dataset. In the video's example, we consider a dataset of patients who respond to two medications, drug A and drug B, based on attributes like age, gender, blood pressure, and cholesterol.

2. **Attribute Selection:** The crucial step is selecting the most predictive feature to split the data. The goal is to choose an attribute that improves classification purity.

3. **Node Splitting:** After selecting an attribute, the data is split into branches based on the attribute's values. The key idea is to achieve purity in the resulting nodes, meaning most cases in a node belong to one class (e.g., all drug A or all drug B).

4. **Entropy:** The impurity of nodes is calculated using the concept of entropy. Entropy measures the disorder or randomness in the data. It quantifies how homogenous the samples are within a node.

5. **Information Gain:** Information gain is the difference between the entropy of the tree before the split and the weighted entropy after the split. It represents how much the split improves classification certainty.

## Attribute Selection Example

- For the medical dataset, attributes like cholesterol and gender are considered.
- Choosing cholesterol as the first attribute results in less pure nodes, making it a poor choice for splitting.
- Selecting gender as the first attribute produces more pure nodes, indicating its greater predictiveness.
- Recursive process: Once an attribute (e.g., gender) is chosen and a branch is formed, further attributes (e.g., cholesterol) are tested for subsequent splits.
- Information gain is used to decide which attribute to choose for splitting, aiming to minimize entropy in the resulting nodes.

## Entropy Calculation

- Entropy is computed using the frequency table of a target attribute, for example, the number of occurrences of drug A and drug B.
- The entropy formula quantifies the impurity of the data before splitting.

## Information Gain Calculation

- Information gain calculates the improvement in certainty achieved by a particular attribute split.
- Information gain is equal to the entropy before the split minus the weighted average of the entropies after the split.

## Choosing the Best Attribute

- The attribute with the higher information gain is selected as the best attribute to split the data.
- The decision tree construction continues by recursively selecting attributes that maximize information gain to achieve the most pure leaves.

## Conclusion

Building a decision tree involves selecting attributes and splitting data to maximize information gain and purity in the resulting nodes. The process is iterative, with the goal of creating a tree that effectively classifies data into desired categories.
