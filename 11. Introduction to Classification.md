## What is Classification?

Classification can be thought of as a means of categorizing or classifying unknown items into a discrete set of classes. It attempts to learn the relationship between a set of feature variables and a target variable of interest. The target attribute in classification is a categorical variable with discrete values.

## How Classification Works

Given a set of training data points along with target labels, classification determines the class label for an unlabeled test case. Let's explain this with an example:

### Example: Loan Default Prediction

Imagine a bank concerned about potential loan defaults. By using previous loan default data that includes customer information such as age, income, and education, the bank can build a classifier. This classifier can predict whether a new customer is likely to default on a loan or not (a binary classification of default or not default).

Please note that classification can also be used for multi-class classification, such as in medical scenarios. For instance, classifying patients into one of three medication options based on their response to treatment.

## Business Use Cases

Classification has various business use cases, including:

- Predicting customer categories
- Churn detection (predicting whether a customer will switch to another provider)
- Predicting customer responses to advertising campaigns

Data classification finds applications across a wide range of industries. Many problems can be expressed as associations between feature and target variables, making classification applicable in numerous scenarios.

## Applications of Classification

Classification can be used in various applications, including:

- Email filtering
- Speech recognition
- Handwriting recognition
- Biometric identification
- Document classification
- And much more

## Types of Classification Algorithms

There are various types of classification algorithms in machine learning, including:

- Decision trees
- Naive Bayes
- Linear discriminant analysis
- K-nearest neighbor
- Logistic regression
- Neural networks
- Support vector machines

In this course, we will cover some of these classification algorithms.

This overview provides a foundation for understanding classification in machine learning, which is essential for solving a wide range of problems across different industries.
