Regression trees: Using real estate data, you'll predict the prices of houses.

Logistic regression: By analyzing customer data from telecommunication companies, you'll observe how machine learning can be used to predict customer loyalty.

K-nearest neighbors: You'll classify telecommunication customers based on their data.

Support vector machines: Using human cell samples, you'll classify them as either benign or malignant.

Multiclass prediction: Working with the popular iris dataset, you'll classify different types of flowers.

Decision trees: You'll build a model to determine which drugs should be prescribed to patients.

K-means: This algorithm will help you segment a customer dataset into groups of individuals with similar characteristics.
