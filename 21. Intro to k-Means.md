# K-Means Clustering

## Introduction
- K-Means Clustering is used for customer segmentation and more.
- It's an unsupervised algorithm that groups data based on similarity.
- Clustering algorithms include partitioning, hierarchical, and density-based methods.
- K-Means is a partitioning clustering algorithm with K clusters.

## Similarity and Dissimilarity
- K-Means aims to minimize intra-cluster distances and maximize inter-cluster distances.
- Dissimilarity or distance measures are used to calculate how different data points are.
- Common measures include Euclidean distance, cosine similarity, and more.
- The choice of measure depends on data type and domain knowledge.

## K-Means Clustering Process
- Imagine a dataset with features like age and income.
- Determine the number of clusters (K) to start the process.
- Choose initial centroids for clusters.
- Calculate distances between data points and centroids (Distance Matrix).
- Assign each data point to the closest centroid's cluster.
- Calculate the error as the total distance of points from their centroids.
- Move the centroids to the mean of their cluster members.
- Recalculate distances and reassign points.
- Repeat the process until centroids no longer move.
- K-Means is an iterative heuristic algorithm.
- It may converge to a local optimum, so it's common to run it multiple times with different initial conditions to improve results.

## Conclusion
- K-Means Clustering is a powerful unsupervised algorithm for grouping data.
- The choice of K, distance metric, and initialization impact results.
- Multiple runs with randomized starting conditions can improve outcomes.

This covers the K-Means Clustering process and considerations.
