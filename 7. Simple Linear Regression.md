# Introduction to Linear Regression

## The Dataset

Let's take a look at this dataset. It's related to the CO2 emission of different cars. It includes engine size, cylinders, fuel consumption, and CO2 emissions for various car models. The question is, given this dataset, can we predict the CO2 emission of a car using another field such as engine size? Quite simply, yes. We can use linear regression to predict a continuous value such as CO2 emission by using other variables.

## What Is Linear Regression?

Linear regression is the approximation of a linear model used to describe the relationship between two or more variables. In simple linear regression, there are two variables: a dependent variable and an independent variable. The key point in linear regression is that our dependent value should be continuous and cannot be a discrete value. However, the independent variables can be measured on either a categorical or continuous measurement scale.

There are two types of linear regression models: simple regression and multiple regression. Simple linear regression is when one independent variable is used to estimate a dependent variable. For example, predicting CO2 emission using the engine size variable. When more than one independent variable is present, the process is called multiple linear regression, for example, predicting CO2 emission using engine size and cylinders of cars. Our focus in this video is on simple linear regression.

## How Linear Regression Works

Now let's see how linear regression works. To understand linear regression, we can plot our variables here. We show engine size as an independent variable and emission as the target value that we would like to predict. A scatter plot clearly shows the relation between variables where changes in one variable explain or possibly cause changes in the other variable. Also, it indicates that these variables are linearly related.

With linear regression, you can fit a line through the data. For instance, as the engine size increases, so do the emissions. With linear regression, you can model the relationship of these variables. A good model can be used to predict what the approximate emission of each car is.

## Using the Fitting Line for Prediction

How do we use this line for prediction now? Let us assume for a moment that the line is a good fit of the data. We can use it to predict the emission of an unknown car. For example, for a sample car with an engine size of 2.4, you can find the emission is 214. 

## The Fitting Line and Its Parameters

Now, let's talk about what the fitting line actually is. We're going to predict the target value y. In our case, using the independent variable engine size represented by x1. The fit line is shown traditionally as a polynomial.

In a simple regression problem, a single x, the form of the model would be y hat = theta 0 + theta 1 x1. In this equation, y hat is the dependent variable of the predicted value, and x1 is the independent variable. Theta 0 and theta 1 are the parameters of the line that we must adjust. Theta 1 is known as the slope or gradient of the fitting line, and theta 0 is known as the intercept. Theta 0 and theta 1 are also called the coefficients of the linear equation.

## Calculating the Parameters

You can interpret this equation as y hat being a function of x1, or y hat being dependent on x1. How would you draw a line through the points? And how do you determine which line fits best?

Linear regression estimates the coefficients of the line. This means we must calculate theta 0 and theta 1 to find the best line to fit the data. This line would best estimate the emission of the unknown data points.

## Minimizing the Mean Squared Error (MSE)

Let's reword it more technically. The objective of linear regression is to minimize the Mean Squared Error (MSE) equation, and to minimize it, we should find the best parameters theta 0 and theta 1.

Now the question is how to find theta 0 and theta 1 in such a way that it minimizes this error? How can we find such a perfect line? Or, to be more precise, how should we find the best parameters for our line? 

## Finding the Parameters

We have two options here: option one, we can use a mathematical approach, or option two, we can use an optimization approach. Let's see how we could easily use a mathematical formula to find the theta 0 and theta 1.

Let's see how we could easily use a mathematical formula to find the theta 0 and theta 1. It is our second parameter. It is used to calculate the first parameter which is the intercept of the line. Now we can plug theta 1 into the line equation to find theta 0. It is easily calculated that theta 0 equals 92.94.

So these are the two parameters for the line, where theta 0 is also called the bias coefficient, and theta 1 is the coefficient for the CO2 emission column.

## Making Predictions

Now, we can write down the polynomial of the line. So, we know how to find the best fit for our data and its equation. Now the question is how can we use it to predict the emission of a new car based on its engine size? After we found the parameters of the linear equation, making predictions is as simple as solving the equation for a specific set of inputs.

For example, let's use theta 0 = 92.94 and theta 1 = 43.98. So, we can rewrite the linear model as Co2Emission = 92.94 + 43.98 EngineSize. Now let's plug in the 9th row of our data set and calculate the CO2 emission for a car with an engine size of 2.4. So Co2Emission = 92.94 + 43.98 x 2.4. Therefore, we can predict that the Co2 emission for this specific car would be 198.492.

## Why Linear Regression Is Useful

Let's talk a bit about why linear regression is so useful. Quite simply, it is the most basic regression to use and understand. In fact, one reason why linear regression is so useful is that it's fast. It also doesn't require tuning of parameters. So, something like tuning the K parameter in K-nearest neighbors, or the learning rate in neural networks isn't something to worry about. Linear regression is also easy to understand and highly interpretable.
