# Evaluation Metrics for Classifiers

In this video, we'll discuss evaluation metrics for classifiers, which are essential for assessing a model's performance in classification tasks.

## Model Evaluation Metrics

Model evaluation metrics play a crucial role in assessing the quality of a machine learning model. These metrics help us understand how well the model performs in classifying data. 

## Three Key Evaluation Metrics

In this video, we'll focus on three important model evaluation metrics for classification problems:

1. **Jaccard Index:** Also known as the Jaccard similarity coefficient, it measures the accuracy of a model. It calculates the size of the intersection of true and predicted labels divided by the size of their union. A perfect match results in a Jaccard index of 1.0, while less accuracy results in values closer to 0.

2. **Confusion Matrix:** The confusion matrix displays correct and incorrect predictions compared to actual labels. It's an important tool for evaluating classification models. It helps us understand true positives, false negatives, true negatives, and false positives, which are vital for computing other metrics.

3. **F1-Score:** The F1-Score is a measure that combines precision and recall. Precision is the accuracy of positive predictions, and recall is the true positive rate. F1-Score is the harmonic average of precision and recall, providing a balance between them. It ranges from 0 (worst) to 1 (best), where higher values indicate a better model.

### Calculating F1-Score

- Precision: Precision = True Positives / (True Positives + False Positives)
- Recall: Recall = True Positives / (True Positives + False Negatives)
- F1-Score: F1-Score = 2 * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall)

We calculate precision, recall, and F1-Scores for each class in a binary classifier. The average accuracy for the classifier is the average of the F1-Scores for both labels.

## Logarithmic Loss (Log Loss)

In some cases, the output of a classifier is the probability of a class label rather than the label itself. For example, logistic regression predicts the probability of customer churn (yes or 1). Logarithmic loss (log loss) is a metric used when dealing with such probability outputs.

- Log Loss measures the performance of a classifier when predicting probability values between 0 and 1.
- Lower log loss values indicate better accuracy.
- It quantifies how far each prediction is from the actual label.

For binary classification, ideal classifiers have smaller log loss values. You calculate the log loss for each row and then find the average log loss across all rows in the test set.

## Conclusion

Evaluation metrics are crucial for understanding the performance of classification models. They help us determine the accuracy, precision, recall, and balance between them. By considering these metrics, we can assess the quality of a classifier and make necessary improvements.

Please note that both Jaccard and F1-Score can be used for multi-class classifiers as well, although this course focuses on binary classification.
