## Applications of Machine Learning
- **Healthcare**: Data scientists use machine learning to predict the likelihood of a human cell developing cancer, determining whether it is benign or malignant. Machine learning plays a vital role in assessing an individual's health and well-being.

- **Medical Decision Support**: You will learn about the significance of decision trees in healthcare. Building effective decision trees from historical data assists doctors in prescribing the most appropriate treatments for their patients.

- **Banking**: Discover how banks utilize machine learning to make informed decisions regarding loan applications. You will also delve into bank customer segmentation, a process made more manageable by leveraging machine learning, especially with large volumes of diverse data.

- **Recommendation Systems**: Explore how machine learning powers recommendation systems on websites like YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix. These systems suggest products or services to customers, such as movie recommendations or book suggestions.

## Practical Implementation
In this course, you will gain hands-on experience using popular Python libraries to build your machine learning models. For instance, you will work with an automobile dataset and use the scikit-learn library to estimate the CO2 emissions of cars based on factors like engine size and cylinder count. Moreover, you will even learn how to predict CO2 emissions for cars that haven't been produced yet. The course will also cover how the telecommunications industry employs machine learning to predict customer churn.

## Hands-On Learning
You will have access to a built-in lab environment throughout the course. No need to install software on your computer or deal with cloud setups. Just click a button to launch the lab environment in your browser. The course provides code samples written in Python within Jupyter notebooks, allowing you to run and modify the code to grasp the algorithms better.

## What You'll Achieve
By dedicating just a few hours a week over the next few weeks, you will acquire valuable skills to enhance your resume, including knowledge of regression, classification, clustering, scikit-learn, and NumPy. You will also develop a portfolio of projects, such as cancer detection, economic trend prediction, customer churn prediction, recommendation engines, and more. Upon completing the course, you will receive a certificate in Machine Learning to showcase your expertise on platforms like LinkedIn and social media.

Let's embark on this exciting journey of learning and discovery in the world of machine learning. Let's get started!
