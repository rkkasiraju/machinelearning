   - B. To automate tasks without human intervention.
   - C. To replace human decision-making entirely.
   - D. To make computers more intelligent than humans.

2. What does "supervised learning" mean in the context of machine learning?
   - A. The computer learns on its own without any guidance.
   - B. The computer learns from labeled data with known outcomes.
   - C. The computer predicts future events without historical data.

4. What does "unlabeled data" refer to in the context of machine learning?
   - A. Data that is missing values and needs imputation.
   - B. Data that has been marked as suspicious and requires further investigation.
   - C. Data that lacks any class labels or known outcomes.
   - D. Data that has been preprocessed for machine learning.

5. Which of the following is a characteristic of unsupervised learning?
   - A. It relies on labeled data for training.
   - B. It is used for regression tasks.
   - C. It discovers hidden patterns in unlabeled data.
   - D. It requires clear classification of data points.

6. What is the primary use of clustering in unsupervised learning?
