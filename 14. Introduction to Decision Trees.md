# Decision Trees in Classification

In this video, we'll introduce and examine decision trees, a powerful tool in classification tasks. Decision trees help us make decisions and classify data based on a series of attribute tests.

## Understanding Decision Trees

- **What is a Decision Tree?** A decision tree is a hierarchical model that visually resembles a tree. It's used for making decisions and classifying data by successively applying attribute tests.

- **Practical Example:** Imagine you're a medical researcher working on a study involving patients who all suffered from the same illness. Each patient responded to one of two medications, drug A or drug B. Your task is to build a model to predict which drug is appropriate for future patients with the same illness.

- **Dataset:** You have collected data about the patients, including features like age, gender, blood pressure, and cholesterol, and the target variable is the drug each patient responded to. This dataset represents a binary classification problem, and you can use it to build a decision tree for making drug-prescription decisions.

## Building a Decision Tree

- Decision trees are constructed by recursively splitting the training data into distinct nodes.

- **Example:** In the case of the drug prescription decision, we start by considering the age of the patient. If the patient is middle-aged, we prescribe drug B. But if the patient is young or senior, we need more information to make the decision.

- Additional decision variables, such as cholesterol levels, gender, or blood pressure, can be used to further split the data. For instance, if the patient is female, we recommend drug A; if the patient is male, we go with drug B.

- Decision trees are all about testing attributes and branching based on the results of these tests. Each internal node corresponds to a test, and each branch corresponds to the result of the test, leading to further tests or decisions. Each leaf node assigns a patient to a specific class.

## Building a Decision Tree Process

- **Attribute Selection:** The process of building a decision tree starts by selecting an attribute from the dataset.

- **Attribute Significance:** Calculate the significance of the attribute in splitting the data. This involves determining if the attribute is effective in making classification decisions.

- **Data Splitting:** Split the data based on the value of the best attribute. This creates branches in the decision tree.

- **Recursive Process:** Continue this process for each branch, recursively creating a decision tree.

## Using the Decision Tree

Once the decision tree is built, it can be used to predict the class of unknown cases or make decisions based on the characteristics of new data points. In the medical example, it helps prescribe the appropriate drug for a new patient based on their attributes.

In the next video, we'll delve into calculating the significance of attributes in the decision tree construction process.
